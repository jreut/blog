  <h1>Hello, World Wide Web!</h1>
  <section>
    <p>
    I'm honored you've come to visit my little Internet placeâ€”and it really is
    little. I bought this domain because I had $12 to spare and this nebulous
    idea about claiming my own little territory within the DNS namespace.
    Fast-forward six years and my crowning Web development achievement was to
    put an SVG party hat on the
    minimalist-because-it-is-just-letters-and-a-square SVG logo that still
    occupies the index at my <code>www</code> subdomain.

    So maybe it's time to start to post some stuff on the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because my job is software development and because I am constantly
    bewildered by the rate of change in the Web ecosystem, I'm writing this
    blog in plain HTML and building it with some convoluted NodeJS scripts that
    I don't understand five minutes after writing them. If you are a masochist,
    you may enjoy browsing the <a href="https://github.com/jreut/blog">source
